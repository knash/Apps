Research Associate with ten years of experience performing data analyses during both doctoral and post-doctoral physics research.
Applied advanced analysis techniques to extract features that typically exist at the part-per-billion level.
Applied machine learning to analyses resulting in a feature extraction sensitivity of a factor of ten over the current state-of-the-art methods.
Published multiple data analyses in peer-reviewed journals including feature exclusion, calibration of feature extraction techniques, and machine learning.
Four years of experience managing analysis groups to produce both published results for journals, and algorithms for the larger collaboration.
